<!-- If you embed audio or video in your website, you should use HTML5.

HTML5 is the next major version of HTML, the primary standard that determines how web content interacts with browsers. HTML5 supports audio and video playback natively in the browser, without requiring a plug-in. With HTML5, you can add media to a webpage with just a line or two of code.

The HTML5 media elements provide simple fallback for browsers that still need to use plug-ins, so you can update your website to HTML5 today and still be compatible with older browsers.

When you use HTML5, you can create your own customized media controllers for rich interactivity using web-standard CSS and JavaScript.

The HTML5 <audio> and <video> tags make it simple to add media to your website. Just include the <audio> or <video> element, use the src attribute to identify the media source, and include the controls attribute.

<video src="mymovie.mp4" controls></video>

There are no plug-ins to install or configure. The audio or video downloads and plays in your webpage with built-in controls. -->
